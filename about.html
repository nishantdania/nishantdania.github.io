<div class="about-me">
	<em>Who am I?</em><br>
	I am Nishant Dania and I recently completed the 3rd year of my Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani. 
	<br><br>
	<em>What do I work on?</em><br>
	I like tinkering with electronic components, mostly arduino and AVR and PIC and BLE and Zigbee and steppers and LED's and sensors and bla bla.
	<br><br>
	<em>What apart from arduino?</em><br>
	I am a designer too. Though I havent been able to give much time to it lately. You can see my work at <a href="https://www.behance.net/nishantdania" target="_blanck"><span>behance.net/nishantdania</span> </a>
	<br><br>
	<em>Is that all?</em><br>
	No. Wait. Forgot the main reason for starting this blog amongst the millions out there.
	<code>I like to code</code>. Most of the articles on this blog would revolve around the projects I work upon. To start with, I will regularly post my progress of making a 3D robot simulator as a GSOC 2014 project under BumbleBee AUV.
